multifile_mover.PY

A script to move multiple files bewteen two directories.

Asks for user's input to locate source and destination directories. When the 
directories are located, the program then asks for the names of the files which
are meant to be moved. If no files are selected, all files (.pdf, .doc, .png)
will be selected. The program then asks for user-defined style with an 
incrementor attached at the end. If there is no user-defined sytle, then the 
files are reformated with their creation timestamp. The files are then moved
to the destination directory.
